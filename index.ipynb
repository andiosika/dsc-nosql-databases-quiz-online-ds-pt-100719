    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll answer some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "\n",
    "noSQL databases aren't tabular in nature and contain key value pairs that can be configured on the fly. SQL databases have more structure.  None is better than the other, as they each have their own applications where they benefit outcomes more.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "A NoSQL database could be better in a situation where the type of data collected is unforseen.  Perhaps in a new application or software where user input is required and it's structure, length and values are to be determined.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "\n",
    "Mongo DB is one that collects data in key value formats.  Keys are assigned on the fly and the values can vary in types.  There are no unique identifiers required for the structure in relational databases.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerance has to do with storing data across multiple servers.  If one or more servers go down, it causes a gap in data and could throw errors. A solution for Fault Tolerance is having backup data for other servers stored across various other servers. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: Map Reduce is the idea of each individual server running and returning the query simultaneously rather than going from server to server Hadoop is a Resiliant Distributed Dataset RDD that addresses this, as does Spark.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
